            I have around 5 years of experience as a software automation engineer. I have worked
            at both small startups and large organizations. As a proficient full-stack
            automation engineer, my expertise is in building scalable automation framework, setting up of the automation cycle execution with CI/CD integration.

        <p>
           I love to make life easier and faster by automating the processes thus making the testing cycle much efficient.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real problems which would add value both in terms of efficiency and quality thus justifying ROI.
           I'm looking for a senior contributor role where I can take on collaborative
           responsibilites, guide a team and gain experience with
           architecture and project management.
